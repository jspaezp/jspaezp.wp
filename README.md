Master Repo for my hugo website

## Super Small Intro

This is a repository that uses the amazing HUGO plataform to create static websites, I am currently using it to post random notes and host my resume but posibilities are endless.

The architecture is quite simple, this repository hosts the variable parts that are used by hugo to generate the `/public` directory, which is the pushed to an additional repository hosted in github.io

There are currently two helper scripts that do that.

the `deploy.bash` script helps making the deployment once the modifications on the posts/pages have occured.

## Disclaimer

I absolutely stole this idea from several places over the internet.
