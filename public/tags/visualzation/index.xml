      <description>This is a small gallery showing some of nice graphics that I have generated.
Overall I think that data visualization is amazing and beautiful and I feel like having a small collection of them would be nice in the future for inspiration (mine and anyone else looking at them). It is to note that labels are poorly labelled on purpose because some data has not been published and I would like to keep it as confidential as posible while still showing the visualization.</description>
